# Aim

Provide a simple experiment regarding the use the **Thompson Sampling** algorithm 

# Thompson Sampling – brief overview
- The TS algorithm builds a distribution of where the expected value of a arm (slot machine) might lie

- This method can only be used for binary outcomes (click add or not click, for example)
- There is a generalization, though, **Gaussian Thompson Sampling**, which takes in to account multiple outcomes (not implemented yet)
